1. Expand your BMI program from LAB-1 in two ways:

Accept user input for both:

the number of inches and,
the weight in pounds.
Output the BMI, along with its rating, i.e., Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, or Obese.

Use https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmicalc.htm (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. as your reference for determining which of the four ratings a BMI score should be given.

Create a file named bmi.py with:

a function bmi(inches,pounds) to perform the calculations and output.

a main program below the function which asks the user for his or her height and weight, then calls your function

To submit:

Upload your bmi.py file.
Copy/paste the sessions from running your program six times with the data shown from my six runs below:
======= RESTART: /Users/mamp/Desktop/WINTER-2018/CIS-40/WEEK-3/bmi.py =======
Enter your height in inches, including decimal fractional parts: 67.75
Enter your weight in pounds: 120
BMI = 18.378834710856335 : Underweight
>>> 
======= RESTART: /Users/mamp/Desktop/WINTER-2018/CIS-40/WEEK-3/bmi.py =======
Enter your height in inches, including decimal fractional parts: 67.75
Enter your weight in pounds: 121
BMI = 18.531991666780137 : Normal weight
>>> 
======= RESTART: /Users/mamp/Desktop/WINTER-2018/CIS-40/WEEK-3/bmi.py =======
Enter your height in inches, including decimal fractional parts: 67.75
Enter your weight in pounds: 163
BMI = 24.964583815579854 : Normal weight
>>> 
======= RESTART: /Users/mamp/Desktop/WINTER-2018/CIS-40/WEEK-3/bmi.py =======
Enter your height in inches, including decimal fractional parts: 67.75
Enter your weight in pounds: 164
BMI = 25.117740771503655 : Overweight
>>> 
======= RESTART: /Users/mamp/Desktop/WINTER-2018/CIS-40/WEEK-3/bmi.py =======
Enter your height in inches, including decimal fractional parts: 67.75
Enter your weight in pounds: 195
BMI = 29.86560640514154 : Overweight
>>> 
======= RESTART: /Users/mamp/Desktop/WINTER-2018/CIS-40/WEEK-3/bmi.py =======
Enter your height in inches, including decimal fractional parts: 67.75
Enter your weight in pounds: 196
BMI = 30.018763361065346 : Obese

2. Write a function named fibonacci(number) that outputs the first number of Fibonacci numbers. The first Fibonacci number is 0, the second is 1, and each of the rest of the numbers are calculated by adding the previous two numbers together. Thus, in my output below, 13 is present because the previous two numbers (5 and 8) add up to 13.

Create a file named fibonacci.py that contains the function AND one call to fibonacci(12).

To submit:

Upload your fibonacci.py file.
Copy/paste your program's output from a single run as I have shown below.
