Use interactive Python to:

1. Calculate the BMI (Body Mass Index) of a 5'7-3/4" person who weighs 153 pounds. Info on BMI calculation is below:

To figure your body mass index, divide your weight in pounds by your height in inches squared; then multiply the result by a conversion factor of 703. The formula is: BMI = weight in pounds / [height in inches x height in inches] x 703.

2. Set a variable named num to 25. Then write an expression that outputs the value of num-cubed (raised to the third power).

3. Set a variable named myName to your full name. Then write an expression using myName that outputs a string similar to this one:  My full name is George Washington.

4. Set a variable named word to one of your favorite words. Then write an expression using word that outputs it 13 times, all in one left-to-right line. For example, my expression outputs:

'PenultimatePenultimatePenultimatePenultimatePenultimatePenultimatePenultimatePenultimatePenultimatePenultimatePenultimatePenultimatePenultimate'

5. Set a variable named miles to a floating point number. Then write an expression using miles that outputs the number of feet in that quantity of miles.

To submit your work, simply copy/paste all five chunks of code into this assignment. Please put blank lines between each chunk and number each chunk. Use a Python comment for this if you like!
